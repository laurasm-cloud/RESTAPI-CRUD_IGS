# RESTAPI-CRUD_IGS

### Instructions ####

The application is setup to launch the application via the IIS Server and to open it directly with swagger in launchapp.json. 
I have used SQL server to connect the db to project, to connect remotely the details are as follows:
- DESKTOP-4ELETC9\SQLEXPRESS and SQL server Authentication login:test and pwd:test. port:1433

Note that as it needs to be integrated the Swagger, I have commented out the api/products so if you rather launch it, it's easy to make the switch in launchsettings.json.

I have added error handling sensible to the results outcome.
