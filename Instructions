### Instructions ####

The application is setup to launch the application via the IIS Server and to open it directly with swagger in launchapp.json. 
The name of the server to connect remotely is DESKTOP-4ELETC9\SQLEXPRESS and windows authentification. 

I have commented out the api/products so if you rather launch it, it's easy to make the switch. 

I have added error handling sensible to the results outcome.
